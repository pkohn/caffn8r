check it out https://rawgit.com/pkohn/caffn8r/master/main2.html

You can: (1) click the words in the word cloud, (2) click on coffee shop names (then scroll down the page to see some summary "deets"), (3) right-click coffee shop names (not map points) and "Open Link in New Tab" to see the Yelp listing for full details and (4) click the map points too :)

Fun stuff! Special thanks to @huttj for all his help and great job teaching me!
